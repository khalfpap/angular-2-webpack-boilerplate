# Angular 2 - Webpack 2 Boilerplate

This project defines the basic project structure and build process needed to create an
[Angular 2](https://angular.io/) web app. 

> This project was created in my ongoing effort to learn Angular 2 and is intended for
> educational purposes. If you are looking to get started building your own Angular 2 apps I would
> recommend a well supported project such as [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Setup

### Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6.0
  ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (`npm install -g yarn`)

### Installation
```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Tasks
Common development tasks are defined as `scripts` in `./package.json`.

### Launch Development Server
```bash
yarn start
```

The `start` script executes Webpack using the development configuration
(`./config/webpack.dev.js`). It will launch a development server that hosts our
application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

While the script is running Webpack will monitor the project for changes
and automatically refresh the page with the latest changes.

### Generate Production Build
```bash
yarn build
```

The `build` script executes Webpack using the production configuration
(`./config/webpack.dev.js`) and outputs the result to `./dist/`.
The output will contain everything needed to deploy the app including
bundled static resources.

### Run Unit Tests
The following scripts launch the Karma test server and execute all unit tests
matching `./src/app/**/*.spec.ts`.

#### Run Once
```bash
yarn test
```

#### Run on Change
```bash
yarn tests
```

The `tests` script will continually monitor the project for changes and run the tests in response.

### Run TypeScript Linter
```bash
yarn tslint
```

Runs TSLint against all TypeScript files in the `./src` folder and prints any violations
to the console.

#### TSLint configuration
The linter rules are configured in `./tslint.json`. It is currently using the
[recommended Codelyzer rules](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer#recommended-configuration) 
to enforce the official [Angular 2 Style Guide](https://angular.io/styleguide).

Most of the linter rules are generic and can be used in any project without modification;
except for the following:
```javascript
  "rules": {
    "directive-selector-prefix": [true, "awb"],
    "component-selector-prefix": [true, "awb"],
    "pipe-naming": [true, "camelCase", "awb"]
  }
```
In this case the prefix string `"awb"` refers to the initials of this project.
This should be changed to something appropriate for the current project.
See [Custom Prefix for Components](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html#!#02-07)
for more details.

## IDE Configuration 

### Visual Studio Code
Configuration is handled by `./.vscode/settings.json`.

#### Enable TypeScript Support
Visual Studio Code provides TypeScript support out of the box. However, in order to
ensure it is using the TypeScript SDK belonging to the project you should
add the following to `./.vscode/settings.json`:
```javascript
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```

#### Enable TypeScript Linter Support
TSLint support can be enabled by installing the
[TSLint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint).

### JetBrains WebStorm

#### Enable TypeScript Support
1. Navigate to "Settings" => "Languages & Frameworks" and ensure that "Node Interpreter"
  is set to the correct version.
2. Update the "TypeScript version" to point to our local copy at `/path/to/project/node_modules/typescript/lib`.
3. Ensure that the TypeScript compiler is disabled. Compilation will happen as part of our
Webpack build process.

#### Enable TypeScript Linter Support
1. Navigate to "Settings" => "Languages & Frameworks" => "TypeScript" => "TSLint"
2. Ensure that "Node Interpreter" is set to the correct version.
3. Update "TSLint package" to reference our local copy at `/path/to/project/node_modules/tslint`.

## Project Configuration

### Base URL
The *Base URL* is the URL or absolute path from which the `./dist/` folder will be served.
This value can be configured by updating `output.publicPath` in `./config/webpack.prod.js`.

## Understanding Webpack
_(my current understanding of Webpack)_

Webpack is a build tool for generating JavaScript
module bundles. A module bundle is a JavaScript file that contains all dependencies
of some root module (entry point). The process is recursive; meaning it will bundle every module in the
dependency tree of the root module.

Webpack supports both CommonJS (i.e., export and require()), and AMD
modules. This project uses CommonJS.

### Bundling Everything
Webpack has the ability to bundle non-JavaScript dependencies including TypeScript, CSS, and binary
resources (such as images and web fonts). This is done through the use of specialized
[loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#loaders) which transform a given resource
into a module that can be included in the JavaScript bundle file.

Some of the loaders demonstrated in this project include:
* The [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) allows CSS to be included
  in a bundle in the same way you would include a JavaScript module using a `require()` or `import` statement.
  CSS that is bundled in this way is injected into the DOM by the Webpack runtime.
* The [awesome-typescript-loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader) can be used to
  transpile TypeScript modules into JavaScript modules that can be included in the bundle.

A list of popular loaders is available [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack#loaders).

### Configuring Webpack
In order for Webpack to function we must provide a configuration file. By default, Webpack will
look for a file called `./webpack.config.js` in the root of the project.

This project includes several annotated Webpack configuration files including
`./config/webpack.dev.js` for development and `./config/webpack.prod.js` to produce a
production build. Both of these configurations inherit from `./config/webpack.common.js`.

### Asynchronous Module Loading
The Webpack **code splitting** feature allows us to load modules asynchronously. Code splitting is the
process of breaking our bundles into "chunks" that can then be loaded on demand.
We can define a new chunk using the `require.ensure` CommonJS method.

For example, in our `main` entry point module (`./src/main.ts`) we define a new
chunk named `app` which corresponds to our main app module defined at `./src/app/index.ts`:

```javascript
// here we create a chunk named "app" containing all our Angular 2 app code
// this chunk will be loaded asynchronously
require.ensure(['./app'], (require) => {
  require('./app').bootstrap(); // bootstrap our app
}, 'app');
```

The resulting output will include a `main.js` file for our `main` entry point;
along with a file called `app.chunk.js` for our `app` chunk. The `main.js` file
will be included in our `index.html` file while `app.chunk.js` will be loaded asynchronously.

A good explanation of code splitting and the motivation behind it can be found at
[Advanced WebPack Part 2 - Code Splitting](http://jonathancreamer.com/advanced-webpack-part-2-code-splitting/).

### Defining Entry Points
Every Webpack configuration includes an `entry` object that defines the entry points for
all module bundles in our project.

For example we define the following in `./config/webpack.common.js`:
```javascript
{
  entry: {
    // defines our two bundle entry points named "polyfills" and "main"
    'polyfills': './src/polyfills.ts',
    'main': './src/main.ts'
  }
}
```

A Webpack configuration must also include an `output` object detailing how the
module bundles are outputted.

Here is how it is defined in `./config/webpack.prod.js`:

```javascript
{
  output: {
    // output directory
    path: helpers.root('dist'),
    // the base URL from which the output files will be served
    publicPath: '/',
    // defines the name of an entry point bundle file
    // "name" refers to the entry point name
    // "hash" is a cache-busting hash
    filename: '[name].[hash].js',
    // defines the name of non-entry point chunks
    chunkFilename: '[name].[hash].chunk.js'
  }
}
```
